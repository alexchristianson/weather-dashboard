 ## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a weather dashboard that would display the weather outlook for multiple cities so users can plan a trip accordingly.

## Description
A user can use the search bar to search for a specific city. When they do so, the user will be presented with the current weather along with a 5-day forecast. The city will also be saved as a button below the search bar so the user can quickly access the weather information for previously searched cities.

## Technology Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* Moment.js
* OpenWeather API
